# Robot Maze Solver (C Project)

## Project Description

This C project aims to implement a robot maze solver that can navigate a grid, find markers placed against walls, and return them to a home square. The project is divided into multiple stages, each building upon the previous one. Below is an overview of the project's main objectives:

### Stage 1: Robot Grid Navigation

In the first stage, the project focuses on displaying a grid with a robot positioned at a selected home square and a marker positioned against a wall. The robot's challenge is to find the marker while avoiding the wall. This stage involves fundamental grid navigation and positioning tasks.

### Stage 2: Marker Retrieval

Building upon Stage 1, the second stage adds functionality to record the robot's movements as it finds the marker. The robot should then pick up the marker and return it to the home square, following the recorded moves in reverse. This stage introduces memory management and algorithm development to handle movement history.

## Challenges

The project offers various challenges, including:

- Algorithm development for grid navigation and marker retrieval.
- Memory management to record and reverse movements.
- Handling multiple markers and ensuring all are collected.
- Efficient ways to determine the completion of the task.
- Implementing the project in the C programming language, which requires careful memory handling and low-level programming.
